HomeAura MarketPlace Project - README
This repository showcases the technical foundation for a scalable and user-friendly e-commerce marketplace. It includes system architecture, workflows, API details, and Sanity CMS schemas to serve as a comprehensive blueprint for implementation.

Overview
This project is focused on creating a high-level technical foundation that aligns with industry best practices. The following components are included:

System Architecture: A detailed design showcasing how different components interact (Frontend, CMS, APIs).
Workflow Diagrams: Visual representations of user journeys and data flows.
API Endpoints: Specifications for data interactions, including products, orders, payments, and shipment tracking.
Sanity CMS Schemas: Pre-designed schemas for managing products, customers, and orders.
Daily Activities and Objectives
Day 3 - API Integration and Data Migration
Objective
Focus on integrating APIs and migrating data into Sanity CMS to build a functional marketplace backend. This process replicates real-world scenarios where data from various sources needs to align with project templates.

Key Learning Outcomes

Understand how to integrate APIs into your Next.js project.
Learn to migrate data from APIs into Sanity CMS.
Use existing data from platforms like Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, WordPress, and others.
Develop skills to validate schemas, ensuring alignment with data sources.
Day 4 - Frontend Component Design
Objective
Design and develop dynamic, reusable frontend components to display marketplace data fetched from Sanity CMS or APIs. This ensures scalable, responsive web application development using modular design principles.

Key Learning Outcomes

Use .env files to store sensitive data like API keys securely.
Follow clean coding practices:
Use descriptive variable names.
Modularize functions for reusability.
Add comments to explain complex logic.
Validate all data during migration:
Use schemas to check field types and constraints.
Log discrepancies for further investigation.
Document every step thoroughly:
Include screenshots, scripts, and testing notes.
Maintain a changelog for schema adjustments.
Implement version control:
Commit changes frequently with meaningful messages.
Tag significant milestones in your repository.
Day 5 - Marketplace Testing and Optimization
Objective
Prepare your marketplace for real-world deployment by thoroughly testing, optimizing, and refining all components to handle customer-facing traffic seamlessly.

Key Learning Outcomes

Test backend integrations for functionality, stability, and performance.
Implement robust error handling for APIs and user inputs.
Optimize the user experience by ensuring fast load times and responsiveness.
Validate all features using performance tools like Lighthouse and GTmetrix.
Ensure security compliance by using HTTPS, sanitizing user inputs, and securing API communications.
Day 6 - Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup
Objective
Ensure the system is deployment-ready by setting up a staging environment, configuring hosting platforms, and validating the application in a production-like environment.

Key Learning Outcomes

Configure staging environments on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
Manage environment variables securely using .env files.
Conduct comprehensive staging environment testing:
Functional testing for all features.
Performance analysis using Lighthouse or GTmetrix.
Security testing to validate secure API communications.
Document testing results, performance reports, and deployment steps in GitHub.
Organize project files with a structured hierarchy and detailed README.md.
